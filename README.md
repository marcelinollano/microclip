Microclip
=========

OK, so I do not know if you read [this great hack that was published on Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/10-Smartphone-to-digital-microscope-conversion/) and promoted on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6624995) a while ago. The basic idea is that inside of a laser pointer there is a lens that could be used as a microscope. Pretty neat. 

One of my favourite gadgets for the iPhone 4S is the [olloclip](http://www.olloclip.com) so I though about doing based upon the same idea but using this lens to have a microscope instead of a macro/fish-eye/wide lens. If you want those [I recommend you to get an olloclip](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=olloclip&linkCode=ur2&tag=marcellano-20).

I broke an old laser pointer to check if it really worked (you can get yours for [almost nothing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KSHXEI/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005KSHXEI&linkCode=as2&tag=marcellano-20)). Turns out laser pointers need lens [to narrow down the beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimator) and we can use that to build a crappy and fun microscope too. I watched [the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpMTkr_aiYU) and I got the idea that it was quite big and I don't have a drill nor plexiglass at home. But I do have a 3D printer.

The result is more compact and portable, but you will need to hold steady the iPhone because the bigger the zoom increment the harder is to focus. Also, you will need some extra light to see the details or just use it against the window on a clear day.

Here are some samples taken using [Camera+](http://campl.us). A green leaf, a finger joint and a fingerprint (all in hipster-scope):

If you want something to use in a classroom probably the other design is better, you will get better images and more image quality. But if you want something to play around and keep on you backpack I think this could be better.

Just download the source files under the `files` folder and customize it. I used an [Ultimaker](http://ultimaker.com) and [Cura](http://software.ultimaker.com) with the best quality setting. It took around 20 minutes to print and then I glued the lens to the plastic, but you may have to adjust the diameter of the hole. If you have an iPhone 5+ I am sorry, you will have to model it yourself. I will not sell these either, this is just a weekend project hack.

Have fun exploring the micro-world!
